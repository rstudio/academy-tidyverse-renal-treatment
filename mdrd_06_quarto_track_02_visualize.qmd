# Instructions

For this final milestone, apply what you have learned about data visualization and exploratory data analysis to further explore the MDRD data set. 

Use at least three related graphs to investigate a variable (or variables) of interest in this data. Your approach should be iterative (graph 2 builds on graph 1) and move you toward better understanding a question of your choosing.

Alternatively, return to a previous milestone and produce a publication-quality table or graph using the skills you have learned this week. Some ideas:

1. Choose a data visualization from earlier in this course and further customize your graph using using themes, annotations, labels and/or aesthetics with ggplot2

2. Create a table, or choose a table you created earlier in this course, and use gt to build the table into an effective standalone figure, including colored cells and a footnote

To learn more about the variables contained in the data set, refer to the data dictionary: https://rsacdn.link/milestones/internal/v2/tidyverse/renal-treatment/assets/mdrd_dictionary.html
