# Instructions

This week, you learned several new functions from dplyr (pronounced DEE-ply-er), a commonly-used package from the tidyverse for wrangling data. You also learned some new ways to enhance your plots.

You'll use these skills to explore how GFR values change over time for individual patients.

To learn more about the variables contained in the data set, refer to the data dictionary: https://rsacdn.link/milestones/internal/v2/tidyverse/renal-treatment/assets/mdrd_dictionary.html

# Milestone

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false
.groups <-  c("class", "groups")

# Load your packages here

```

## Summarize data

In this milestone you'll create, visualize, and compare summary statistics for the 255 patients included in the data set.

## Recreation

### Part 1 - Import

Before you begin, you will need to import your data set. Use the code chunk below to read the data from the data file `mdrd.csv`, which is stored in the `data/` folder in your working directory. Be sure to save the data to an object named `mdrd`.

```{r}
#| label: recreation-import

```

### Part 2 - Summarize data

This week, we'd like to analyze the change in GFR (glomerular filtration rate) over time for each patient in the MDRD study. Specifically, we'll calculate a `gfr_slope` variable, which is computed as follows, for each patient:

> (last GFR - first GFR) / time elapsed

Run the code below to see a table.

```{r}
#| label: recreate-this
#| message: false
solution <- readr::read_csv("data/milestone02.csv")
solution
```

Your task is to use what you've learned about the dplyr package to transform `mdrd` into this table. You will need to:

1. Group the data by `ptid`. 
2. Summarize the `gfr_slope` for each patient.

Work in the code chunk below. Save the result as `patient_summary`. We will use the result in Part 3.

_Hint_: consider functions `last()`, `first()`, and `max()` from the dplyr package, as well as the `months` variable in the data set, which represents the number of months since the start of the study.


```{r}
#| label: recreation-summary

```

Run the following code chunk to test whether you have the same answer as the solution:

```{r}
#| label: compare
#| eval: false
waldo::compare(patient_summary, solution, tolerance = 1e-4, ignore_attr = .groups)
```

### Part 3 - Visualize

Let's display our results visually. Using the File Explorer, navigate to the `images/` directory, then click on `milestone02.png` to open an image.

Use the code chunk below to create the plot above. Begin with the `patient_summary` table. *Hint: you can adjust the width of the bins with the `binwidth` argument.*

```{r}
#| label: recreation-plot

```

## Extension

Using the code chunk below, investigate a research question about this data, using the data wrangling skills you learned this week. Some ideas:

1. How does change in GFR over time differ for patients patients who dropped out of the study compared to those who didn't drop out?
2. Most patients have more than two GFR measurements taken -- how else can you compute and visualize change in GFR over time other than calculating the difference between the first and last GFR values?
3. How much variation is there in the number of months between GFR measurements across patients? How does this relate to change in GFR over time?
4. [any other research question of interest]

Alternately, working with a data set of your own, complete the following:

1. Read in your data
2. Use `group_by()` and `summarize()` to produce simple a table from some subset of your data 
3. Create a related graph of this data subset using ggplot 

```{r}
#| label: extension
