# Instructions

For this final milestone, apply what you have learned about data transformation and modeling to further explore the MDRD data set. Consider the following steps:

1. Read in your data
2. Wrangle your data so it is in a format that is ready for modeling
3. Create a simple regression model to make predictions about patient outcomes and inspect your model results using functions from the broom package

To learn more about the variables contained in the data set, refer to the data dictionary: https://rsacdn.link/milestones/internal/v2/tidyverse/renal-treatment/assets/mdrd_dictionary.html
